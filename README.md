    - if dealer has a Ace and a Jack, count is 21 (black jack)
    - if dealer has a Ace and eight, count is 18 (dealer stops hitting at this point)
3. If dealer loses/busts player gets 2 times the bet amount associated with each hand put on 'stand'.
4. If there is a tie, player gets back the bet amount associated with the hand.
5. No re-splitting allowed.
6. Deck has 1 pack of cards (13 from each suite).
